v1.2.0 (2026-10-23)
-------------------

This is the final feature release of Blop. Development continues in
`bluesky-adaptive <https://github.com/bluesky/bluesky-adaptive>`_ 1.0.

Features
........
* **Single-run optimization (experimental)**: ``blop.plans.optimize_in_run`` runs the optimization
  loop inside one Bluesky run, using ``blop.plan_stubs.list_scan_in_run`` for acquisition
  (`#353 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/353>`_).
* ``optimize`` and ``Agent.optimize`` accept ``iterations=None`` to run until the optimizer's
  stopping criterion is met (`#364 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/364>`_).
* ``default_acquire`` records suggestion IDs in scan order as ``"blop_acquisition_order"`` start
  metadata. Use it to match acquired data to suggestions
  (`#365 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/365>`_).
* ``optimize`` checkpoints after each iteration, so a deferred pause stops between iterations
  (`#378 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/378>`_).

Breaking Changes
................
* Optimization runs record one event per suggestion, with an ``iteration`` field, instead of one
  event per iteration with array values. ``read_step`` no longer takes ``n_points``
  (`#376 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/376>`_).

Compatibility Notes
...................
* ``EvaluationFunction`` and ``AcquisitionPlan`` are generic over the uid type
  (`#370 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/370>`_).
* Suggestion ``"_id"`` values must be unique and hashable, and evaluation functions must return
  exactly one outcome per suggestion ID (`#353 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/353>`_).

Bug Fixes
.........
* String fields such as suggestion IDs are no longer truncated to the length of their first value
  (`#363 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/363>`_).
* ``default_acquire`` accepts ``md``, which the Queue Server runner requires
  (`#359 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/359>`_).

Dependency Changes
..................
* New ``scipy`` extra, included in ``all`` (`#374 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/374>`_).

`Full Changelog <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0>`__

v1.1.0 (2026-08-26)
-------------------

Features
........
* **SciPy backend**: The new ``blop.scipy`` namespace provides Bluesky-compatible
  wrappers for SciPy's local minimization, SHGO, and dual annealing routines
  (`#339 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/339>`_).
* **Global stopping criteria**: The new ``SupportsStoppingCriteria`` protocol allows an
  optimizer to stop an optimization run early. ``Agent`` and ``AxOptimizer`` now accept
  an Ax global stopping strategy directly
  (`#337 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/337>`_,
  `#338 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/338>`_,
  `#341 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/341>`_).
* **Queueserver checkpointing**: ``QueueserverAgent.run()`` and
  ``QueueserverOptimizationRunner.run()`` now accept ``checkpoint_interval``. The checkpoint
  path can also be set on an existing ``Agent`` or ``AxOptimizer``
  (`#327 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/327>`_,
  `#328 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/328>`_).
* **Flexible string actuators**: Ax DOFs backed by a queueserver device string can now specify
  a separate ``name``, supporting components whose queueserver path and device name differ
  (`#346 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/346>`_).
* **Generalized XRT simulations**: ``blop-sim`` can now construct arbitrary XRT beamlines from
  XML descriptions and infer Bluesky-compatible motors and detectors
  (`#317 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/317>`_).

Compatibility Notes
...................
* **Optimization event identifier renamed**: The ``bluesky_uid`` field in optimization event
  documents is now ``acquisition_uid``. Acquisition plans may return any hashable identifier,
  rather than only a Bluesky run UID
  (`#350 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/350>`_).
* **Protocol signatures generalized**: Core protocol methods now use ``Sequence`` and
  ``Mapping`` instead of concrete ``list`` and ``dict`` types, and evaluation functions receive
  a ``Hashable`` acquisition identifier. Runtime behavior remains compatible, but custom
  protocol implementations may need their annotations updated to satisfy static type checkers
  (`#350 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/350>`_).

Bug Fixes
.........
* Evaluation failures are now registered with fault-aware optimizers before the original
  exception is re-raised, preventing failed suggestions from remaining pending
  (`#355 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/355>`_).
* Suggestion routing now guarantees that every suggested point is visited exactly once, fixing
  edge cases that produced cycles and duplicate visits
  (`#356 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/356>`_).
* Queueserver submission now uses the manager's native autostart API and relies on its
  allowed-device and allowed-plan validation, allowing remote errors to propagate correctly
  (`#326 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/326>`_,
  `#344 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/344>`_).

Documentation and Development
.............................
* Added a how-to guide for configuring built-in and custom Ax stopping conditions
  (`#342 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/342>`_).
* Added a contributor guide and documented the project's review and merge policy
  (`#331 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/331>`_).
* Added a dedicated integration test suite and CI workflow for complete optimization runs
  (`#349 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/349>`_).

`Full Changelog <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0>`__

v1.0.0 (2026-07-16)
-------------------

Features
........
* **Xopt backend**: New optional ``blop.xopt.XoptOptimizer`` backend, installable via the
  ``blop[xopt]`` extra, implementing the ``Optimizer``, ``Checkpointable``,
  ``CanRegisterSuggestions``, and ``TrialFaultAware`` protocols on top of
  `Xopt <https://xopt.xopt.org>`_ (`#318 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/318>`_).
* **Scalarized objectives in `Agent`**: ``Agent`` can now be configured with
  ``ScalarizedObjective`` for weighted multi-objective optimization
  (`#284 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/284>`_).
* **Best point(s) navigation**: New ``blop.plan_stubs.navigate_to_best`` plan stub that moves
  actuators to the best point(s) found so far, backed by ``Optimizer.get_best_points()``
  (`#293 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/293>`_).
* **Queueserver plan keyword arguments**: ``QueueserverOptimizationProblem`` now accepts
  additional keyword arguments to pass through to the acquisition plan
  (`#306 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/306>`_).
* **More reliable queueserver runner**: The queueserver runner now starts its listener
  automatically on initialization (`#316 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/316>`_), tracks
  its state with ``concurrent.futures.Future`` for more robust status reporting
  (`#305 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/305>`_), and ``QueueserverAgent`` now exposes
  additional runner properties (``actuators``, ``sensors``, ``acquisition_plan``,
  ``current_iteration``) and a ``stop()`` method directly
  (`#291 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/291>`_).

Breaking Changes
................
* **`QueueserverClient` now takes a `RemoteDispatcher`**: Replaces the previous raw ZMQ address
  argument, giving users full control over how documents are dispatched from the queueserver
  (`#308 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/308>`_).
* **`QueueserverAgent` moved to its own module**: ``QueueserverAgent`` now lives in
  ``blop.ax.queueserver_agent`` instead of ``blop.ax.agent``. The ``queueserver`` optional
  extra was also renamed from ``qs`` to ``queueserver``
  (`#321 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/321>`_).

Bug Fixes
.........
* Made ``ChoiceDOF`` hashable, fixing a bug when reconfiguring or fixing ``ChoiceDOF`` parameters
  (`#301 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/301>`_).
* Fixed stream filtering in the optimization logging callback
  (`#302 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/302>`_).
* Fixed the queueserver runner calling ``stop_listener`` from the wrong thread, and used the
  correct ``run_start`` key on the stop document
  (`#291 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/291>`_).
* Queueserver runner now prevents concurrent/parallel runs
  (`#296 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/296>`_).
* Fixed the import path for ``ContourPlot`` (`#281 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/281>`_).

Dependency Changes
..................
* Reworked and clarified the optional-dependency structure, adding an ``all`` extra and
  renaming the ``qs`` extra to ``queueserver``
  (`#321 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/321>`_).

Documentation
.............
* **Queueserver integration marked experimental**: Clearly documented across module
  docstrings, the tutorial, and the API reference that the queueserver integration is
  experimental and subject to change (`#309 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/309>`_).
* New tutorial for running Blop optimization against a remote Bluesky Queueserver
  (`#292 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/292>`_).
* Improvements to the XRT KB mirror tutorial (`#311 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/311>`_)
  and the simple experiment tutorial (`#303 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/303>`_), plus a
  general documentation maintenance pass
  (`#294 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/294>`_).
* New explanation content describing which components of an optimization workflow
  (evaluation functions, acquisition plans) users are responsible for implementing
  (`#323 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/323>`_).
* Website redesign, including a version-switcher dropdown in the docs header
  (`#269 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/269>`_,
  `#277 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/277>`_,
  `#279 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/279>`_,
  `#287 <https://github.com/bluesky/blop/pull/287>`_,
