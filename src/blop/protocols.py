class Optimizer(Protocol):
    """
    A minimal optimizer interface for optimization.

    This protocol defines the interface for optimizers in Blop. Most users will use
    the built-in :class:`blop.ax.optimizer.AxOptimizer`, which provides Bayesian optimization
    via Ax. Custom implementations are only needed for specialized optimization algorithms.

        Returns a set of points in the input space, to be evaulated next.

        The "_id" key is optional and can be used to identify suggested trials for later evaluation
        and ingestion.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_points : int | None, optional
            The number of points to suggest. If not provided, will default to 1.

        Returns
        -------
        list[dict]
            A list of dictionaries, each containing a parameterization of a point to evaluate next.
            Each dictionary must contain a unique "_id" key to identify each parameterization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        points : list[dict]

class EvaluationFunction(Protocol):
    """
    A protocol for transforming acquired data into measurable outcomes.

    This protocol defines how to extract and compute optimization objectives from
    acquired data. Custom implementations are needed to define how your beamline
    data translates into the outcomes you want to optimize.

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation function is called after data acquisition to compute outcomes
    from the acquired data. It should extract relevant data from the Bluesky run
    and compute objective values and metrics for each suggestion.

    Examples
    --------
    See the tutorial documentation for complete examples of evaluation functions:
    :doc:`/tutorials/simple-experiment`

        ----------
        uid: str
            The unique identifier of the Bluesky run to evaluate.
        suggestions: list[dict]
            A list of dictionaries, each containing the parameterization of a point to evaluate.

class AcquisitionPlan(Protocol):
    """
    A protocol for custom data acquisition plans.

    This protocol defines how to acquire data from the beamline. Most users will use
    the default :func:`blop.plans.default_acquire` plan, which performs a list scan
    over the suggested points. Custom implementations are only needed for specialized
    acquisition strategies (e.g., fly scans, complex detector configurations).

    Notes
    -----
    The acquisition plan is a Bluesky plan that should move the movables to each
    suggested position and acquire data from the readables. It must return the UID
    of the Bluesky run so that the evaluation function can retrieve the data.
