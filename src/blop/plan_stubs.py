    This plan moves through the suggestions, optionally reordering them for efficient motion,

    .. warning::

        The single-run optimization API is **experimental**. This plan may change in

    Parameters
    ----------
    suggestions : Sequence[Mapping]
        Suggested parameterizations to execute. Each suggestion must contain a hashable ``_id``.
    actuators : Sequence[Actuator]
        Actuators to move to the suggested positions.
    sensors : Sequence[Sensor] | None, optional
        Sensors that produce data to evaluate. Non-readable sensors are ignored.
    per_step : bp.PerStep | None, optional
        Bluesky list-scan step hook. Custom hooks may emit any number of events into any streams.
    **kwargs : Any
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to :func:`bluesky.plans.list_scan`.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[Hashable, ...]
        Suggestion IDs in the order the suggestions were executed.
