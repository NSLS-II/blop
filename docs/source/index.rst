What is Blop?
-------------

Blop is a Python library for performing optimization for beamline experiments. It is designed to integrate nicely with the Bluesky ecosystem and primarily acts as a bridge between optimization routines and fine-grained data acquisition and control. Our goal is to provide a simple and practical data-driven optimization interface for beamline experiments.
